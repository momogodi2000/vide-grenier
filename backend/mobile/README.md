    "last_name": "Doe",
    "user_type": "CLIENT",
    "two_factor_enabled": false,
    "google_oauth_enabled": false
  }
}
```

## User Types

### CLIENT
- Full access to all client features
- Can create products, place orders, manage favorites
- Access to wallet and transactions
- Can enable/disable 2FA

### ADMIN
- All client permissions
- Access to admin dashboard
- User management
- Product moderation
- System statistics

### VISITOR (No Authentication)
- Browse products
- Search functionality
- Add items to cart
- Create orders without account
- Access to pickup points

## 2FA Implementation

### Setup Process
1. User enables 2FA via `/user/setup_2fa/`
2. System generates QR code (in production, use proper 2FA library)
3. User scans QR code with authenticator app
4. 2FA is enabled for the account

### Login Process with 2FA
1. User submits login credentials
2. If 2FA is enabled, system sends verification code via email
3. User enters verification code
4. System validates code and generates tokens

## Google OAuth

### Implementation Notes
- Currently returns "not implemented" response
- In production, integrate with Google OAuth API
- Verify access token with Google
- Create or update user account with Google data

## Visitor Functionality

### Cart Management
- Session-based cart using unique session keys
- No authentication required
- Persistent across app sessions
- Automatic cleanup of old carts

### Order Creation
- Visitors can create orders without accounts
- Required fields: customer name, phone, email
- Pickup point selection required
- Order confirmation via email/SMS

## Payment Integration

### Supported Methods
- Mobile Money (MTN, Orange, etc.)
- Card payments
- Cash on delivery

### Payment Flow
1. User initiates payment
2. System generates payment reference
3. User completes payment via chosen method
4. System verifies payment
5. Order status updated

## Error Responses

### Standard Error Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Server Error

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:
- `page` - Page number (default: 1)
- `page_size` - Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

### Pagination Response
```json
{
  "count": 100,
  "next": "http://localhost:8000/mobile/api/products/?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [...]
}
```

## Testing

Run the mobile API tests:
```bash
python manage.py test backend.mobile.tests
```

## Development

### Adding New Endpoints

1. Add serializers in `serializers.py`
2. Add views in `views.py`
3. Add URL patterns in `urls.py`
4. Add tests in `tests.py`

### Example: Adding a New Endpoint

```python
# serializers.py
class NewModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = NewModel
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'description']

# views.py
class NewModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = NewModelSerializer
    queryset = NewModel.objects.all()

# urls.py
router.register(r'new-models', NewModelViewSet, basename='mobile-new-models')
```

## Security

- All sensitive endpoints require authentication
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- 2FA support for enhanced security
- CORS is configured for mobile development
- Input validation is enforced on all endpoints
- Admin endpoints require admin user type
- Visitor endpoints allow anonymous access

## Production Considerations

### 2FA Implementation
- Use proper 2FA library (e.g., `django-two-factor-auth`)
- Implement QR code generation
- Add backup codes functionality
- Consider SMS as alternative to email

### Google OAuth
- Integrate with Google OAuth API
- Handle user data securely
- Implement proper error handling
- Add account linking functionality

### Payment Gateway
- Integrate with local payment providers
- Implement webhook handling
- Add payment status tracking
- Implement refund functionality

### SMS Integration
- Integrate with SMS service providers
- Implement rate limiting
- Add SMS delivery tracking
- Handle SMS failures gracefully
